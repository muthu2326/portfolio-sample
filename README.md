# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website, built using HTML and Basic CSS to showcase my work and provide a way to contact me.

## Pages Overview
- **[Home Page]**: Offers an introduction to who I am, my background, and a summary of my skills and experience.
- **[Contact Page]**: Provides a simple contact method, featuring my email address and/or social media links.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for content structure.
- **Basic CSS** for styling and layout.

## View the Website
To view the website, open `index.html` in your preferred browser or visit [sample-portfolio website](https://muthu2326.github.io/portfolio-sample/) if it's hosted online.

## Future Enhancements
I plan to expand the content and improve the design as I progress.
